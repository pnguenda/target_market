## Need to Do ##

**Paule**
* Deploy on Heroku

**Grant**
* Cleaned Jupyter Lab file of model development
* Revise create_model.py script based on Jupyter Lab file (Grant & Dave)
* Provide one or two more visualizations of machine learning model

**Eric**
* Clean website (e.g., buttons and such)
* Clean up language on website (with help from all)

**Dave**
* Continue testing to see if site can be broken
* Create on form on website to capture user classifications
* Separate images into folders based on user classifications rather than model classifications
* Find code that will update model based on the newly-uploaded images rather than create a whole new model
* Create button to smarten algorithm?

**Model Development**
* use 500 x 500 pictures?
* implement overfitting procedures?
* gather more images?

**Target Marget Strategy**
* Return several addresses within a radius? A simple form entry of a single address, returns a table of brick homes, in a radius of that initial address entered. This final table will list homes for sales/marketing.
* Produce map of neighborhood brick house density?

**Considerations**
